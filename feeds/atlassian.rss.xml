We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before. 

We recently raised our Series B, signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud, and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need”, (over 23k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role? 
We’re looking for an Engineering Program Manager to join Cohere’s Tech organization. As the first candidate hired into the EPM organization, we need someone who will bring curiosity, drive, independence, and leadership to the company. You should have hands-on experience managing projects for consumer software development and machine learning solutions, and building large-scale foundational processes and programs to improve engineering operations. 

In return, you will have the unique opportunity and responsibility to design the way that Cohere will operate for years. You’ll get to build relationships with some of the leading AI and NLP minds in the world, collaborate with other Cohere teams like Product, Business, and Marketing, have significant visibility and impact on a fast-growing product, and contribute to the company culture.

This role will start as an individual contributor, but with a rapidly growing product and staff, there will be ample opportunities for both leadership and career growth.

Why this role?
As a Solutions Architect at Cohere, you’ll play a huge role in growing the business and will have an immense sense of autonomy when it comes to technical pre and post-sales.  You will work closely with the sales and business development teams to lay the foundation for Cohere’s growth.  Together, you will engage customers from different audience groups (e.g., developers, start-ups, enterprise customers) to understand their challenges.  You are comfortable leading conversations from an early stage with the customer and are naturally curious about their business.  You will play a hands-on role in designing and executing experiments that demonstrate the transformative impact of our models.  You have the technical credibility to instill confidence in the Cohere platform and our solutions including how best to integrate our API into customers’ products. 

It’s a highly self-directed role, so you should be someone who thrives in an unstructured, rapidly evolving environment.

We recently raised our Series B, signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud, and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language.
