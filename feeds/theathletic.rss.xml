Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity, and encourages “unboring” solutions to problems. We enable all new engineers to deploy working code their first week, and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager, mentor and team.

See below for more information.*

The Team:
What really sets us apart from most other treasury and finance roles and teams is that we really prioritize work life balance and want to ensure this is a “grind-free” environment. It’s also a silo-free environment so you will truly get exposure of areas outside of the norm to help make you a well-rounded professional and, well, mingle a little!
While we like to have fun and a laugh, of course there are times we get busy, so let’s break down...

Position Overview:
Reporting directly to the Corporate Treasurer, you and the Treasury function will grow with Yelp.  The candidate will be a key contributor to the team in managing the reporting and covenant monitoring for existing and future funding facilities; analyzing and optimizing liquidity, capital structure planning, capital allocation and potential funding strategies; provide support for areas including cash management, cash flow forecasting, share repurchase strategies, FX hedging and funding,  investment portfolio and potential capital markets/financing activities and Yelp’s corporate insurance program.  Other strategic initiatives that the candidate will work on include defining high-level roadmaps and goals on optimizing and scaling out our current payment platform to support product initiatives while monitoring and communicating progress

And after that user has found the perfect restaurant and is happily munching on their quinoa salad, who makes sure our logs are transported, transformed, and indexed so that we can create more awesome experiences for them next time? We do: the data backend engineers who make these systems work fast, efficiently, and at scale.

We’re looking for experienced engineers to join our team to build elegant, scalable systems that use NoSQL data stores, data warehouses, batch processing, and stream processing solutions to empower Yelp-wide use of Machine Learning to solve impactful business problems whether it’s  providing a delightful user experience, data driven decision-making or ensuring the trustworthiness of Yelp’s content and protecting the platform from abuse. If you’re the person who leads their team to constantly improve existing systems and dives fearlessly into solving complex problems, then we’re looking for you!

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity, and encourages creative solutions to problems. New hires are empowered to deploy working code their first week -- and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager and mentor. At the end of the day, we are all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

We’d love to have you apply, even if you don’t feel you meet every single requirement in this posting. At Yelp, we’re looking for great people, not just those who simply check off all the boxes.

This opportunity is fully remote and does not require you to be located in any particular area in Canada. We welcome applicants from throughout Canada.

And after that user has found the perfect restaurant and is happily munching on their quinoa salad, who makes sure our logs are transported, transformed, and indexed so we can do even better next time? We do! The platform engineers at Yelp make these systems work fast, efficiently, and at scale.

We’re looking for experienced engineers to join our team and build elegant, scalable platforms  that bring the potential of data streams to Yelp’s features teams. From transporting events reliably between services and datastores with Kafka to processing massive streams of data in real-time with Flink and Beam, our team offers simple abstractions to power a whole host of personalized experiences for Yelp’s users and drive optimizations for Yelp’s advertising businesses.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages “unboring” solutions to problems.

At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Yelp connects people with great local businesses, but who connects search queries to 180M+ reviews on millions of businesses in under 400 milliseconds? Who selects the perfect ad from millions of options in the blink of an eye? And after that user has found the perfect restaurant and is happily munching on their quinoa salad, who makes sure our logs are transported, transformed, and indexed so we can do even better next time? We do! The platform engineers at Yelp make these systems work fast, efficiently, and at scale.

We’re looking for experienced engineers to join our team and build elegant, scalable platforms  that bring the potential of data streams to Yelp’s features teams. From transporting events reliably between services and datastores with Kafka to processing massive streams of data in real-time with Flink and Beam, our team offers simple abstractions to power a whole host of personalized experiences for Yelp’s users and drive optimizations for Yelp’s advertising businesses.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity and encourages “unboring” solutions to problems. New hires are expected to deploy working code their first week, and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager and mentor. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

Yelp has hundreds of millions of pieces of user-contributed content, millions of users and business listings, and hundreds of thousands of advertising customers – and all of these numbers are constantly growing. Making sense of this data, deducing relationships between variables, and figuring out different interactions is hard work, but these insights are hugely impactful to Yelp’s business. Applied scientists uncover these insights through exploratory research and analysis, and carry the ideas all the way through to production-grade statistical or predictive models. They work in areas including pricing models and auction bidding strategies, learning to rank applications, personalized recommender systems, trust and safety / spam detection, and causal inference.

Yelp engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that encourages individual authenticity and “unboring” solutions to problems. We enable all new team members to deploy working code their first week, and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager, mentor, and team. At the end of the day, we’re all about helping our users, growing as engineers and scientists, and having fun in a collaborative environment.

The Yelp Strategy team supports this mission by working with leaders to help Yelp stay one step ahead of trends and competition. The Strategy work is leveraged by executives to chart an efficient and decisive course over a 3 year time horizon. 

The Strategy team works to identify the growth opportunities and threats in our business. The team synthesizes internal analyses and external data, pulling it all together into a strategic direction that is refreshed over time.  Strategy helps ensure that teams across the company align investments with Yelp’s strategic direction.

As an Analyst or Senior Analyst on the Strategy team, you’ll develop analyses and synthesize competitive landscape data to drive actionable industry insights for our executives.  As you master landscape assessment, you’ll then also work on internal strategy projects, helping operating leaders synthesize customer &amp; competitive insight into an agreed direction, objectives, and potential growth levers.  You’ll be reporting to a Strategy Team Lead and work closely with the SVP of Strategy.  

We’re looking for someone with a knack for synthesis - the ability to find and integrate a broad range of qualitative and quantitative sources into pithy, impactful insights. You are a highly driven and proactive person with a record of high impact and achievement, eager to apply your analytical and creative talents to new challenges. You are a team player who is an excellent communicator, quick learner, and as excited about Yelp as we are.

Candidates must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to qualify for this role. See below for more information.

This is a full-time remote role based in the United States.
