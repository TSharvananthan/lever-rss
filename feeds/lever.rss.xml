Our people are Lever’s biggest competitive advantage. For more information on our team culture, visit https://inside.lever.co/.

THE OPPORTUNITY
As an Engineer on our Product team, you’ll help us build out our core product by developing high-impact, user-facing features. In our growing engineering organization, you’ll be developing and shipping new features and updates to Lever’s product. You’ll be learning about our real-time web stack UI frameworks that help us deliver a beautiful and high quality solution to our customers. In addition, working on API's and integrations to support our partners. You’ll work collaboratively with product managers and designers to drive the implementation and release of major features, and be a champion of best practices for writing well-tested, well-organized code.

You’ll become familiar with all parts of our stack—including our open source web framework, DerbyJS. You will exercise judgment in making tradeoffs between design and feasibility. You’ll engineer extension points to be scalable and resilient in a complex, single-page application.

We believe that user-centric design ultimately leads to the best products, so we listen closely to our users, both external and internal. As an engineer on our close-knit, cross-functional team, you’ll be an active voice in shaping our product. Lever is constantly rolling out high-demand features and tackling ever greater challenges of scale. 

THE TEAM
You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about minimizing downtime. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things--automation, friendly chat bots, creating a great hiring experience, and a great user experience--and we love sharing those passions with each other.

Read about what our team values and why here. 

THE TECH STACK
Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, TypeScript, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

THE CHALLENGE 
Design is one of Lever’s core competencies. As a Product Designer on the team, you will contribute to an elegant, seamless, and empowering user experience for the hiring teams who rely on Lever every day. We believe well-designed user experiences in the workplace are key to displacing stale and broken status-quo software. Built from the ground up with user-centered design methodology and principles, Lever is the only hiring software that is mobilizing entire companies to effortlessly collaborate on hiring. 

As a Product Designer, you’ll use your expertise to take on design challenges across multiple stages of our design and delivery process. Understanding our users is core to how we work, through UX research, testing (and re-testing!) design concepts, and ongoing feedback from customers. We’re looking for a designer with a strong track record of designing high-quality digital solutions, with an eye to both the user experience and visual design; someone who takes a collaborative approach to solving problems, partnering with teams across Lever to deliver delightful, easy-to-use experiences to our users.

THE OPPORTUNITY
We’re building a world-class, product-first organization and assembling the right team to begin scaling aggressively. This is an opportunity for someone who wants to be part of something impactful and transformative, and will play a critical role in driving Lever’s success. This is also the perfect fit for someone who is keen to take on design projects that range from iterative feature improvements, all the way through to exploring new, innovative functionality.

THE TEAM
Our Design team is a small (but mighty!) group of generalists with a broad set of skills and experiences, who are continuously learning from each other. Our team is exceptionally collaborative, thoughtful, and passionate about user-centered design. We work closely with our partners in Product Management and Engineering. As part of this team, you’ll shape the Lever user experience based on our design principles and research insights, contributing to our mission to help the world hire with conviction and connect talent to meaningful work.

THE CHALLENGE
Lever's engineering team is growing rapidly and we're looking for another Engineering Manager to help scale the org. Our team is a thoughtful bunch that cares about delighting our customers by excelling at both code quality and design thinking. We value transparency and believe in fostering an inclusive, collaborative, helpful team environment. We're always looking for ways to do better for our customers, the product, and for the team: #continuous-improvement.

THE TEAM
Working as part of Engineering's leadership team, you will be one of Lever's key technical leaders.

THE OPPORTUNITY
We’re looking for an engineering manager who is inspired to mentor, grow, and help teams succeed, especially when the team is still small and nimble. You’re an experienced people manager and adept project manager who can guide developers to perform at their best (without sacrificing sleep) and also remove any blockers that may appear.

As an engineering manager, you’ll lead a team of product developers as they evolve and enhance our core web app.  You will build an energized and capable team by hiring top-notch talent and by engaging and mentoring current employees. You’ll make sure that projects are running without a hitch; and bridge the gap with Product &amp; Design to make sure that what we are building is on target and prioritizing customer value. As we onboard bigger customers and continue to evolve our hiring product, you’ll guide your team to execute with efficiency, consistency, and, above all, empathy. That’s the Lever way.

THE TEAM
Working as part of Engineering's leadership team, you will be one of Lever's key technical leaders. You will be joined by several other leaders within product engineering, infrastructure, IT, and architecture. You will also engage with product managers and business leaders to build alignment on technical direction and will provide thought leadership across the company.
