Availability:
This is a full-time exempt level position

What You'll Do:
You’ll be responsible for planning, developing, and implementing our content pipeline.  
 
You’ll strategize and project manage, but mostly you’ll be writing!

We’re looking for someone to write typical B2B content – blog posts, case studies, email, e-books, etc. – that doesn’t read like your typical (terrible) B2B content.   And you’ll do this while avoiding all the traps and tropes common to the genre. You’ll resist the easy cliche, the empty jargon, and the overwrought sentence. You’ll aim for more than vapid generalizations and sophomoric insights.     You’ll write things that are clear and conversational, interesting and useful.
