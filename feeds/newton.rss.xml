Operating in over 100 countries, Nielsen is the market leader when it comes to measurement, information and insights within the Media industry. Being the trusted partner to many advertisers, agencies and media owners - we pride ourselves on integrity, accuracy and quality to ensure our clients are making informed decisions to optimise their growth.

The Nielsen Media Analytics team is an innovation hub.  It is tasked with answering client questions in new and innovative ways, creating new products and services that address industry gaps.  Our goal is to keep Nielsen Media at the cutting edge of measurement.  The Research team forms an integral part of this team; owning and guiding others in our narrative and storytelling frameworks.   We work with the biggest names in the media industry and are looking for someone who is curious and has a good understanding of research methodologies.

About You:
This is an exciting opportunity for a talented, passionate Research Manager to thrive in a unique environment.  Working to support teams across 25+ markets, the Research Manager will help guide the path of the international Media Analytics business at a local, regional and international level.  

The Media Analytics function has several overarching products which are available in many countries.  At the same time, individual markets also have their own particular client questions to address.  This means that our Research Manager must be able to straddle both and be able to see the bigger picture and the detail.  

Other key characteristics which will be core to success in this role include the ability to be an intelligent yet quick thinker.  Working with Nielsen and 3rd party data requires critical analysis but also a lot of common sense!  This requires curiosity, not just about methodologies and data, but also into the global marketing landscape including local, often singular, nuances.  

The research manager should be a keen observer of the phenomena which they will then need to analyse and interpret.  Not only this but, key to this role will be the ability to teach and mentor others to do the same.  This requires a people person, a patient, sympathetic colleague with the wish to help others to thrive.   

To be successful in the role, the research manager must be organised, collaborative, keen to learn and always act with integrity. They must also always be willing to teach others to be the same.
