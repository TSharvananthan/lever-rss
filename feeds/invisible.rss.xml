Information is a powerful and essential element of the user experience. For developers, this is even more true – without great documentation, it is nearly impossible to build new apps, services, and products.

At Atlassian, we look at the way we communicate technical information to our internal and third-party developers as an end-to-end journey. This journey begins as developers get started with building on the Atlassian stack, and ends with a living set of reference materials that answer any question they may have as they build, launch, monitor, and support their work.

You can explain complex features and capabilities in ways that are useful for experienced audiences, but which are also helpful for more novice readers getting into the domain or learning a new API.

We are looking for candidates who love to work with teams to ensure they are providing a great information experience. Someone who is ready to not only own the documentation for their domain, but also contribute to and help drive projects that benefit the larger documentation community here at Atlassian.

Your future team

The developer and app infrastructure teams within UI Platform are motivated to push the boundaries of what it takes to ensure world class experiences that feel fast, connected and efficient at enterprise scale. You will work across many UI Platform developer and infrastructure teams that build our internal products, developer environments, practices, tooling and delivery pipelines that thousands of Atlassian developers rely on and use daily. These teams support Atlassian's performance and scale goals which our enterprise customers rely on.

We believe information is important to any user experience. When you join Atlassian as a Content Designer, you become part of the Atlassian Design organization. Content Design includes everything needed to understand, support, market, and use that product. You won't own all the content, but you'll help make sure the stories we tell are consistent and create a great experience for our customers.

Customer support at Trello is different.
To start with, we let our customers decide if they want to pay us or not. Seriously. If our customers aren't amazingly happy, they get their money back with no questions asked. Our front line staff is empowered to make our customers happy. Usually, it means tapping a broad range of resources, whether that’s making sure you have all the right software or working directly with an engineer to troubleshoot a case. You’ll have what you need to get the job done.

You won’t be glued to the queue. Sure, we need to get back to customers—that will always be there—but support is so much more than grinding through an inbox. This is a real problem-solving job. You’ll have an incredible amount of autonomy in determining how best to contribute your talents and skills to Trello. Think a short video will help customers get started? Make it. Want to write a script to help a customer with the API? Go for it. There’s plenty of room for creativity and technical exploration when it comes to better serving our customers.

Information is a powerful and essential element of the user experience. For developers, this is even more true – without great documentation, it is nearly impossible to build new apps, services, and products.

At Atlassian, we look at the way we communicate technical information to our internal and third-party developers as an end-to-end journey. This journey begins as developers get started with building on the Atlassian stack, and ends with a living set of reference materials that answer any question they may have as they build, launch, monitor, and support their work.

This is not a traditional technical writing role. As part of the Developer Experience team at Atlassian, you'll be empowered to experiment with a variety of approaches to creating information in the documentation, supporting materials, and anywhere else our developers experience information.

More about you

This job is for someone who thinks bigger than traditional software documentation. You can explain complex features and capabilities in ways that are useful for experienced audiences, but which are also helpful and approachable for more novice readers getting into the domain or learning a new API.

We are looking for candidates who love to work with teams to ensure they are providing a great information experience for developers. Someone who is ready to not only own the documentation for their domain, but also contribute to and help drive projects that benefit the larger developer experience community here at Atlassian.

Love staying ahead of the cloud growth curve and experimenting with new software and environments? Get on board as an Atlassian Site Reliability Engineer.

As an Engineer in the Enterprise Agility Site Reliability Engineering team, you'll build solutions to enhance availability, performance and stability for the hundreds of Atlassian enterprise customers in the Cloud as well as automating away repetitive work.

Job Description:

We're looking for an experienced senior director to create a new function inside the CSS Business Transformation team. As the Head of BizOps for CSS you’ll make recommendations for solving complex business problems, operate and mature our staff planning methodology, recommend Key Results for the CSS Operating Plan, and scale your team. You’ll be accountable for picking the right problems to solve in order to achieve our mission of scaling CSS.

Success in this role will require you to have a keen business mind and the ability to communicate effectively to executive leaders across a large number of complicated and ambiguous topics. You’ll need to take a multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving and find a balance between thoroughness and speed. You’ll need to operate with precision with all financial aspects of the role. If you're passionate about leadership, exhilarated by complex problem solving, and motivated by scale, then this is the role for you!

Your peer group consists of leaders running our Business Architecture, Program Delivery, and Analytics functions. Along with your peers you'll partner with senior leaders outside of CSS Business Transformation and CSS to deliver impactful outcomes to the organization. You’ll build and maintain a strong relationship with a peer in the finance org. You’ll be starting with a small team that you’ll scale over time.
 
Your areas of accountability:

- Build this new function from the ground up into one that adds a high amount of value for organizational outcomes
- Precision, accuracy, and efficiency of the global CSS staff planning business.
- Make effective recommendations on the structure and content of the CSS operating plan Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to the CSS Leadership team
- Design and run a scalable and efficient process for creating an amazing quarterly operating plan for CSS
- Research complex business problems and communicate recommendations to executive leadership
- Maintain a rolling six quarter view of staffing for your team. Achieve in-quarter hiring goals with high quality hires
- Sustain healthy partnerships and transparent interfaces with other departments you and your team rely on

More about you:

You obsess about delivering outcomes and have experience being accountable for large decisions. You're a builder, architect, and inventor. You have fun working in areas of high speed, complexity, and ambiguity. You’re an offer maker, not an order taker. You think about the full business first, then how your function drives big outcomes. You maintain positivity for yourself and your team, even in the face of adversity and setbacks. Failures are opportunities to learn and build resilience.

You enable and empower the team to deliver outcomes without needing you in every meeting. You understand where the business is going and proactively hire for the skills needed to solve tomorrow's problems.

Today customers are becoming more and more particular about their data, not just in the way it's stored and transmitted but also in the ways it is processed by organizations. Needless to say, handing over the finer control of their data to opt-in, opt-out, or for free usage is a must-have for any organization. On the other hand, the cost of not having this is huge, customers are not going to use our products with confidence which would decrease customer trust and directly affect the revenues. 

Atlassian today is 6000 people engineering org and is growing quickly. How do we create a system for all the engineers so that they are able to focus on their core businesses while being aware of the privacy and data needs but not having to be worried about them? Imagine a scenario where a customer has a complete view of how their data (both UGC and Usage data) is being processed or prevented from being processed. How do we continue to show the customers that they have control of their data and there are systems which honor that? 

If any of this excites you, then this is a wonderful opportunity to be a part of this team and build this from scratch. This team is going to be a part of the Trust Engineering org, which solves various interesting engineering challenges in the Trust org spanning risk and compliance, security, security intelligence, trust engagement, etc.

Atlassian is looking for a Data Engineer to join our Go-To Market Data Engineering (GTM-DE) team which is responsible for building our data lake, maintaining our big data pipelines / services and facilitating the movement of billions of messages each day. We work directly with the business stakeholders and plenty of platform and engineering teams to enable growth and retention strategies at Atlassian. We are looking for an open-minded, structured thinker who is passionate about building services that scale.
On a typical day you will help our stakeholder teams ingest data faster into our data lake, you'll find ways to make our data pipelines more efficient, or even come up ideas to help instigate self-serve data engineering within the company. Then you will move on to building micro-services, architecting, designing, and enabling self serve capabilities at scale to help Atlassian grow.
You'll get the opportunity to work on a AWS based data lake backed by the full suite of open source projects such as Spark and Airflow. We are a team with little legacy in our tech stack and as a result you'll spend less time paying off technical debt and more time identifying ways to make our platform better and improve our users experience.
More about you:
As a data engineer in the GTM-DE team, you will have the opportunity to apply your strong technical experience building highly reliable services on managing and orchestrating a multi-petabyte scale data lake. You enjoy working in a fast paced environment and you are able to take vague requirements and transform them into solid solutions. You are motivated by solving challenging problems, where creativity is as crucial as your ability to write code and test cases.
