About the User Voice Group

Help and support, especially at scale, is a complex and exciting problem space. With a mission of “Every user empowered, every voice heard”, Canva’s User Voice super group is the critical interface to our most valuable partners, our users. We want to ensure that they have a flawless experience while using Canva products as we scale our way to support 1 billion users. Our teams are responsible for unlocking how we can deliver exceptional customer experience through streamlined and scalable systems, an optimized contact flow, expert support specialists, customer insights, plus tools to enable self-help such as our Help Center, Assistant and Chatbot.

About the Help Centre and Assistant Team

User Voice’s Help Center and Assistant teams design and build self-help experiences for millions of people using Canva around the world. 

Our Help Center team is responsible for making it easy to find and use how-to and troubleshooting content as well as architecting the help experience platform that is at the heart of how we deliver help content to users.

This impactful team works closely with our content and machine learning teams to scale the capabilities and influence of the Assistant for our users.

About Content Design at Canva

We're on a mission to help our users fulfill their goals with clarity and joy.

We’re looking to achieve this by building an amazing team with a culture of clear and crisp writing. Our focus is on systems, not just sentences. We create and improve flows, not just the words. We seek to have a deep impact on key areas, not just shallow impact everywhere. 

Content Design is a small and growing part of our Design specialty. Canva sees content as a crucial part of its ongoing success – and we’re really focused on improving our content experience. We have a fun, human voice that we want to do a better job of getting across to our users, instead of, you know, “generic UX writing” voice. 

We’re passionate about working together to create the future of Content Design at Canva; it’s not a top-down approach. Your opinion matters! You’ll also get lots of support from the diverse content team across the business. As soon as you arrive, we’ll be saying “Thank goodness you’re here!” 

The content design specialty collaborates closely with PMs, Designers, Engineers and Design Researchers to identify solutions that prioritize our users’ needs.

About the team
The User Platform team is responsible for managing and authenticating users, groups and roles, preferences, avatars and much more. Our system is the backbone of Canva’s backend service architecture and offers exciting challenges around system design, reliability and performance. The team is committed to scale our platform according to our exponential user base growth, which currently sits at over 85 million monthly active users, and we are just getting started.

In User Platform we decompose existing services, we build up new ones from scratch and deeply care about software design. We constantly improve the way we get the most performance out of AWS resources and along the way we ship new features to improve the user experience for Enterprise and Education customers and their sophisticated organisational needs.

As a result of this growth, we are looking for a Software Engineering leader to manage a team of 5 backend engineers to evolve the User Platform to a scalable system of services that provide useful building blocks for our internal Canva teams.

Howdy, howdy! This opportunity is huge - we are a small Smartmockups team, working on the Canva product!  Smartmockups helps people and businesses the world over create engaging visual materials. Our online mockup tool features a stellar mockup library, intuitive design tools, and is available anywhere, anytime. Smartmockups is the easiest way to showcase your designs on real-world products. Launched in 2016, Smartmockups proudly joined the Canva family in 2021.We're on a common mission to revolutionize product visualizations and help bring the design for 85 MAUs to life! 

Engineering is at the heart of Canva, from the simple, straight forward and creative UI to the performant, computer science challenges of scaling and running a continuous engineering environment.

The Canva code base was built to scale from day one. We promote a warm and collaborative work environment where engineers set big goals and are given the tools and support to achieve them. 

Finally - you're probably curious about our technology stack. At a high level, Canva's backend is powered by a set of services (some micro, some not-so-micro) built primarily in Java, hosted on Linux, sitting on AWS. We also sprinkle in some powerful open-source libraries and tools, as well as bespoke components to power some of the magic. Canva stack is slightly different from what we use at Smartmockups - backend technologies that we use are Node.Js, WebGL, HTML Canvas, AWS, MongoDB, etc.


About the Team 

We have an ambitious roadmap of integrating SM product visualization into Canva and need the help of more BE engineers to help with those goals.In total we have 12 people in engineering - we all still have a big impact and the ability to do crazy big things. Our Engineering consists of three teams - two of them are working on Canva integrations - Smartmockups product and Smartmockups tool in Canva. This backend engineer will join our team to work on critical Smartmockups &lt;&gt; Canva integrations. Join us and design your future.

About the Infrastructure Group: 
The Infrastructure Group's focus is to make infrastructure easy for all the other engineering teams at Canva. We accomplish this by optimizing existing solutions, developing internal tooling, promoting best practices throughout the organisation, introducing global infrastructure changes, and mentoring the engineering teams on how to do infrastructure - the right way.  We work as a team to find the pragmatic solutions to a wide range of performance and scaling problems to ensure Canva continues to grow and our users have smooth and seamless design experiences.

This focus on long term growth is made possible by every engineering team at Canva owning the operations and infrastructure of the systems they design and implement, instead of having a dedicated ops team: on the spectrum between ops and dev, the Infrastructure Group operates very close to dev, so the skills required are also close to those required for dev work, with a focus on software engineering fundamentals.

The Cloud Platform Group:
Within Infrastructure, is the Cloud Platform Group. They are made up of approximately 60 Software Engineers, and their goal is to enable the safe, secure and reliable operation of canva.com and internal workloads. Cloud Platform’s mission is to reduce the complexity of using the Cloud (we use AWS) so that engineers can focus on their own domains. We build products to support engineers across the company to easily provision and configure Cloud resources, release, run and operate workloads. And our goal is to ensure it's all done in the simplest and most secure way possible.

Software engineering is the core of who we are at Canva. The Canva code base was built to scale from day one. This has allowed for a unique environment where engineers spend most of their time optimizing performance and releasing new features rather than fixing legacy code. With adherence to fundamentals and first principles, the team strives to use the most appropriate tools for the tasks at hand, aiming to strike that carefully measured balance between getting things done and the long-term maintainability of the code base and supporting infrastructure.

We promote a warm and collaborative work environment where engineers set big goals and are given the tools and support to achieve them. We also invite our engineers to contribute to the direction their peers are taking with proactive pair-ups for peer-reviewing of code as well as regular engineering forums for opinions and ideas to be heard. These practices ensure that knowledge is shared and releases are quick and efficient.

At Canva, we celebrate diversity. We deeply believe that bringing together diversity of thoughts, perspectives and expression is key to building the best product, team and company. We look for many different skills and abilities, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. So, even if you don’t think you quite meet all of the skills listed or tick all the boxes, we’d still love to hear from you! 

Our mission at Canva is to empower the world to design and since launching in 2013, we have grown exponentially, amassing over 86 million monthly active users across 190 different countries and a team of over 3,000 people… and the best bit is that we’ve only achieved 1% of what we know we’re capable of. 

Join us and design your future.

Software engineering is the core of who we are at Canva. The Canva code base was built to scale from day one. This has allowed for a unique environment where engineers spend most of their time optimizing performance and releasing new features rather than fixing legacy code. With adherence to fundamentals and first principles, the team strives to use the most appropriate tools for the tasks at hand, aiming to strike that carefully measured balance between getting things done and the long-term maintainability of the code base and supporting infrastructure.

We promote a warm and collaborative work environment where engineers set big goals and are given the tools and support to achieve them. We also invite our engineers to contribute to the direction their peers are taking with proactive pair-ups for peer-reviewing of code as well as regular engineering forums for opinions and ideas to be heard. These practices ensure that knowledge is shared and releases are quick and efficient.

About the Cloud Platform Group:
The Cloud Platform Group is made up of approximately 60 Software Engineers, and their goal is to enable the safe, secure and reliable operation of canva.com and internal workloads. Cloud Platform’s mission is to reduce the complexity of using the Cloud (we use AWS) so that engineers can focus on their own domains. We build products to support engineers across the company to easily provision and configure Cloud resources, release, run and operate workloads. And our goal is to ensure it's all done in the simplest and most secure way possible.

About the Core Data Team:
Core Data is a newer team within Cloud Platform, and their main mission is to take the data persistence mission to the next level. Not only provisioning and configuring resources as per the best of the practices but also be absolute experts in the technologies we most frequently leverage in Canva. They do that by contributing to the application layer (owning the technology libraries/services used for common operations, like access, sharding and abstractions) and dropping into service teams as consultants to help with modelling and performance optimisations, etc.
We expect the team to have a mix of skillsets but the strongest representation will be of Software Engineers who will be solving a multitude of problems with code. We need them to be comfortable with the fundamentals of database internals (data structures, threading, etc).

Core Data’s focus for the rest of the year is building out the database offerings for a new internal platform that we’re launching within Canva. We’re working on tooling and internal services that make it easier for Canva Engineers to work with all forms of data persistence, from provisioning storage to managing the lifecycle of their schemas.

Content Strategy sits alongside Content Design as a small and growing part of our Design specialty.

We’ve got a lot of content, but we need to do a better job of delivering the right content to the right people at the right time – and fixing silos.

About the group/team

The Hardware &amp; Access Management team supports the evaluation, implementation, administration, and ongoing innovation of identity and access technology across our internal IT systems. 

We use Okta as our primary IDP, and with the scale of our organisation, we’re constantly integrating new technology and applications behind and in front of it. We’re looking for someone to help continue our investment into scalable identity &amp; access systems and beyond. 

This includes onboarding &amp; offboarding, entitlement propagation, supporting flexible employment patterns, application integration &amp; access management, and more!

About the role/specialty

We’re looking for a software engineer with experience in designing and building systems that process access requests, entitlements, and provisioning.

In doing so, you’ll have a direct impact on the productivity of thousands of Canvanauts across the business, by reducing the ambiguity and inefficiencies that come with having to manage access at a large-scale startup like Canva. 

Rather than manual service desks and sending our users to application owners, we want to create systems that make granting access as simple and secure as possible. Our vision is to remove manual processes and approval chains whilst striking a fine balance with security.

Frequently engineers host engineering forums where new ideas, practices, and technologies are discussed – ensuring everyone on the team is continually learning and evolving.

The Canva code base was setup to scale; from day one. This has allowed for a unique environment where engineers spend most of their time optimising performance and releasing new features rather than fixing legacy code. This also ensures that it’s just more fun working on the code base. We also have a flat structure where engineers are invited to comment on the direction their peers are taking and are paired for pair-reviewing to occur. This ensures that knowledge around the code base is shared and speed of release occurs. You can find more about our engineering practices in this blog article (Medium Blog).

At present, we have over 10 million users, across web and mobile platforms, in 30 languages, in over 100 countries and we're growing exponentially.  Why aren't you a part of that?

At Canva, we celebrate diversity. We deeply believe that bringing together diversity of thoughts, perspectives and expression is key to building the best product, team and company. We look for many different skills and abilities, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. So, even if you don’t think you quite meet all of the skills listed or tick all the boxes, we’d still love to hear from you! 

Our mission at Canva is to empower the world to design and since launching in 2013, we have grown exponentially, amassing over 86 million monthly active users across 190 different countries and a team of over 3,000 people… and the best bit is that we’ve only achieved 1% of what we know we’re capable of.

Engineering is a core part of who we are. You will work with a carefully selected team of ex-Google, VMware, ThoughtWorks, and Atlassian engineers. The team takes pride in its focus on engineering fundamentals. We strive to use the most appropriate tools for the tasks at hand, and to strike a measured balance between getting things done and long term maintainability. The team is tight, with no big egos, and welcomes engineers to come and join in on the adventure. Engineers frequently host sessions where a new idea or software engineering practice is discussed — this ensures that everyone in the team is constantly learning.

We work hard to get our fundamentals right across the business. Consequently, the frontend code base is constantly being improved and optimised so new features can be implemented easily. We also have a flat structure where engineers are invited to comment on the direction their peers are taking on features. When a new feature is being built, engineers review each other’s code; this ensures that knowledge is shared and it doesn’t need to be reworked. You can find more about our engineering practices in this blog article.

The Infrastructure Group:
At Canva, the Infrastructure Group's focus is to make infrastructure easy for all the other engineering teams at Canva. We accomplish this by optimizing existing solutions, developing internal tooling, promoting best practices throughout the organisation, introducing global infrastructure changes, and mentoring the engineering teams on how to do infrastructure - the right way.  We work as a team to find the pragmatic solutions to a wide range of performance and scaling problems to ensure Canva continues to grow and our users have smooth and seamless design experiences.

This focus on long term growth is made possible by every engineering team at Canva owning the operations and infrastructure of the systems they design and implement, instead of having a dedicated ops team: on the spectrum between ops and dev, the Infrastructure Group operates very close to dev, so the skills required are also close to those required for dev work, with a focus on software engineering fundamentals.

The Cloud Platform Group:
Within Infrastructure, is the Cloud Platform Group. They are made up of approximately 60 Software Engineers, and their goal is to enable the safe, secure and reliable operation of canva.com and internal workloads. Cloud Platform’s mission is to reduce the complexity of using the Cloud (we use AWS) so that engineers can focus on their own domains. We build products to support engineers across the company to easily provision and configure Cloud resources, release, run and operate workloads. And our goal is to ensure it's all done in the simplest and most secure way possible.

About the role 

The Data Engineer empowers Canvanauts to discover insights from our data. They are a steward of organizational knowledge, not a researcher answering a specific question. Like a librarian, the data engineer curates the catalog so that the researchers can do their work more effectively.

They apply software engineering best practices on a daily basis. Their purpose is to maintain and operate the data platform to deliver well-defined, transformed, tested, documented, and code-reviewed data sets. 

We handle Billions of rows and Petabytes of data from hundreds of different sources - including events, databases, and third-party systems. We work in collaboration with multiple teams and stakeholders to support their decision-making process. We work every day to make Canva one of the most valuable companies in the world and to do the most good along the way. We are looking to grow our team and multiply our impact.

About the [group/team/speciality/sub] speciality 
The Ecosystem group contributes to Canva’s growth towards 1 billion users by creating an abundant app ecosystem that tailors to the diverse needs of our users across all demographics. We are launching a new and improved Canva API (currently in Alpha) that gives developers more power and flexibility with the potential to build what we cannot imagine!

Canva Ecosystem is a team with 50 engineers predominantly located in Sydney, Australia. Our developer platform has had its foundations laid with a handful of narrowly scoped integration points within the product - now it’s time for us to go big with an API surface area that is significantly larger and with the potential to build what we cannot imagine. There is so much opportunity in this space and our crazy big goal is to have hundreds of developers and thousands of integrations built with Canva.

The Ecosystem strategy involves three priorities: Build and scale the Canva API to enable deep integrations into (and outside of) Canva’s editor product to create a truly delightful experience for both our developers and their customers by building high-quality integrations with strategic partners for the benefit of Canva’s users.

Product Management @ Canva 

The mission of Product Managers at Canva is to create the most accessible design tool for every person in the world. We believe that we can improve the world by empowering everyone to design and communicate visually. As a Product Manager at Canva, you help set this vision, define what that future looks like, and build the products and features that get us there.

Product Managers collaborate with Canva’s founders to set the strategic direction, scope, and success metrics for product initiatives. We work across teams of designers, software engineers, marketers, and analysts to ensure we're delivering an exceptional experience to all our users. We are responsible for implementing and collaborating on product strategy, road mapping, and prioritization as our product grows. 


About the User Voice Help Centre team

The Canva User Voice Help Centre team’s mission is to make getting help and inspiration simple for everyone and every design. Their purpose is to make it easy to exchange help, ideas, and inspiration with people using Canva around the world.

We’re looking for someone with a user-first mentality who is comfortable using qualitative and quantitative inputs to make decisions. You’ll be equally comfortable partnering with product designers to develop and execute customer research and developing hypotheses for experiments with data analysts. Your experience operating in dynamic environments while moving teams from ambiguity to clarity will see you shine in this role. You will have a respectful and collaborative way of working, and a crystal-clear communication style.

About the team
Canva’s Ecosystem Group was formed in 2021, unifying Canva’s developer ecosystem investments, to create an abundant (app and developer) ecosystem that tailors Canva for each user. Our aim is to build the world’s richest Ecosystem of apps and integrations for visual design and communications on Canva. We are building strategic integrations, developing a platform to enable apps with seamless workflows and building an array of developer tools. 
We are building out the next-generation developer platform, called the Canva API, to provide developers flexibility in creating innovative app experiences within Canva. We are already working with a number of third-party developers using the Canva API, and you will have the opportunity to shape the future of this platform and the corresponding app ecosystem.

About the Product Design team

One of the principles of our design team is to ‘show the future’. As designers we transport the rest of the company into a future we’re yet to build. A big part of the role of a product designer at Canva is to be a visionary—visualising and reinventing the future of design. 

Product designers at Canva take the dream and make it something everyone can relate to and rally behind. We start from the very early stages: finding the right problem to tackle, exploring ideas for how to solve it and then refining it into a coherent solution. Our product designers carry out research, brainstorming, sketching, prototyping, and collaboration with our engineers to ship great products.  We are empathetic user advocates and respect our users’ opinions through interviews, usability testing, and data analysis, as well as wireframing, flowcharting, and journey mapping to show the different stages that customers go through as they come into contact with Canva.

We have multiple teams hiring product designer, including Education, Video, Payments &amp; Revenue, Onboarding &amp; more...

About the Design Automation team

The Design Automation team is on a mission to make Canva the fastest and easiest design tool in the world! We are part of a larger group, tasked with looking after the overall editing experience on every device.

We’re motivated to create ‘magical’ experiences for users and to do this well we need to deeply understand who we’re designing for. As such, data science and user research is a huge part of our team’s focus.

Much of our work is exploratory and forward-thinking – and our focus is not limited to a specific set of features or a particular product area. Our insights and discoveries often lead us to pursue projects that support other teams and groups. Curiosity, communication and collaboration are therefore critical to our team’s success.

We are looking for someone who can solve complex problems with a systematic approach in a fast-paced environment. Working within a cross-functional team you’ll be collaborating to deliver new products that will have a large-scale impact on Canva and end-users.

We start from the very early stages: finding the right problem to tackle, exploring ideas for how to solve it and then refining it into a coherent solution. Our product designers carry out research, brainstorming, sketching, prototyping, and collaboration with our engineers to ship great products.  We are empathetic user advocates and respect our users’ opinions through interviews, usability testing, and data analysis, as well as wireframing, flowcharting, and journey mapping to show the different stages that customers go through as they come into contact with Canva.

About the Product Design team

One of the principles of our design team is to ‘show the future’. As designers we transport the rest of the company into a future we are yet to build. A big part of the role of a product designer at Canva is to be a visionary—visualising and reinventing the future of design. 

Product designers at Canva take the dream and make it something everyone can relate to and rally behind. We start from the very early stages: finding the right problem to tackle, exploring ideas for how to solve it and then refining it into a coherent solution. Our product designers carry out research, brainstorming, sketching, prototyping, and collaboration with our engineers to ship great products.  We are empathetic user advocates and respect our users’ opinions through interviews, usability testing, and data analysis, as well as wireframing, flowcharting, and journey mapping to show the different stages that customers go through as they come into contact with Canva.

About the group you’ll be joining 

The User Growth group is on a mission to increase activation, frequency of use, and drive viral adoption of Canva globally. We’re laser focussed on driving impact on monthly active user (MAU) metrics that are mission critical for us achieving our company goals.

We leverage our mature experimentation framework, data, and research capabilities to maximise the performance of our top-of-funnel product-led growth engine, which encompasses new users' first experience as they visit Free Design Tool: Presentations, Video, Social Media | Canva, sign up, and familiarise themselves with all that Canva has to offer.
We have come a long way, but we have huge company growth aspirations and crazy big goals; as a product designer joining the User Growth group you’ll be critical in helping us make Canva a household name.

About you

We are searching for a Product Designer with experience in growth design to drive the design direction for our product’s virality loops to capitalise on existing active users to attract new users. This includes identifying high-impact product ideas, working alongside product and marketing, and delivering end-to-end experiences that help Canva grow virally through creating product experiences that users fall in love with.

You will have a direct impact on our key active user metrics by ensuring that existing active users who love our product become product advocates and help to attract new users. You will work closely with a cross-functional team to design experiments that articulate and test hypotheses, wielding data to provide insights that inform a path forward. You are motivated by fast-paced, iterative product improvements that truly move the needle.

You will work with product designers, content designers, product managers, data analysts, and engineers across the User Growth group, Product Growth supergroup, and Canva, and have a team-focussed design mentality. You are excited for and have experience in leveraging every aspect of the user-centered design process to tackle challenging user problems and are comfortable collaborating with and influencing stakeholders across Canva to achieve alignment and buy-in.

We’re motivated to create ‘magical’ experiences for users and to do this well we need to deeply understand who we’re designing for. As such, data science and user research is a huge part of our team’s focus.

Much of our work is exploratory and forward-thinking – and our focus is not limited to a specific set of features or a particular product area. Our insights and discoveries often lead us to pursue projects that support other teams and groups. Curiosity, communication and collaboration are therefore critical to our team’s success.

We are looking for someone who can solve complex problems with a systematic approach in a fast-paced environment. Working within a cross-functional team you’ll be collaborating to deliver new products that will have a large-scale impact on Canva and end-users.

About the Canva Creators Group

Since Canva’s founding, our template library has been a critical and fundamental driver of our success. Fundamental to making design accessible to the world is giving people everywhere a springboard with which to create designs from. Templates are that springboard. 

Templates provide inspiration to users, help them visualise what's possible and provide an approachable starting point for our users to get creative. In fact, templates are the way the majority of our users create designs so the templates teams are helping millions of people each week. 

Historically, Canva’s templates have been designed by a talented team of internal graphic designers. But last year we launched Canva Creators, a platform that allows anyone to publish their templates and earn money every time they’re used. We believe Canva Creators has the potential to take Canva to the next level of scale, and we want you to be central to that growth.

You will be working in partnership with a Product Design Lead, supported by a tight family of talented front-end and back-end engineers, and some kick-ass PMs to ensure that our template designers, and Creators alike have the best experience when using and publishing templates. You’ll not only get to deliver products that our 50 million users touch, but also work closely with internal graphic designers to improve the tools they use day-to-day to power Canva’ library.

At Canva, our mission is to democratize design and empower creativity and visual expression for every person, on every platform.  Since launch in April 2013, our user base has grown exponentially, amassing over 10 million users in over 100 languages, making us one of the world's fastest-growing technology companies.  As of today, we've achieved profitability, and the company is valued over $1-billion, which comfortably prepares us for the next phase of growth and development.

Software engineering is the core of who we are at Canva.  The Canva code base was built to scale from day one. This has allowed for a unique environment where engineers spend most of their time optimizing performance and releasing new features rather than fixing legacy code.  With an adherence to fundamentals and first principles, the team strives to use the most appropriate tools for the tasks at hand, aiming to strike that carefully measured balance between getting things done and long-term maintainability of the code base and supporting infrastructure.

You'll be joining a team of skilled technologists with previous experience at companies such as Google, JetBrains, Yandex, Atlassian, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook; leveraging their knowledge and experience building mass-scale web applications for consumers and businesses alike.

We promote a warm and collaborative work environment by embracing a flat structure where engineers set big goals and are given the tools and support to achieve them.  We also invite our engineers to contribute to the direction their peers are taking with proactive pair ups for peer-reviewing of code as well as regular engineering forums for opinions and ideas to be heard.  These practices ensure that knowledge is shared and releases are quick and efficient.  (For a deeper look into Canva's engineering culture, here's an article by our CTO, Dave, discussing how we get things done.)

Finally - you're probably curious about our technology stack.  At a high level, Canva's backend is powered by a set of services (some micro, some not-so-micro) built primarily in Java, hosted on Linux, sitting on AWS.  We also sprinkle in some powerful open-source libraries and tools (have a look at finagle), as well as bespoke components to power some of the magic.

About the group

Our Product Growth Supergroup exists to drive Canva’s user &amp; revenue growth through product-led growth strategies that demonstrate the full value of Canva’s products to our users.

We are responsible for the overall revenue growth from our business customers, by driving adoption of our subscription products: Canva Pro &amp; Enterprise. 

Growing our adoption and expansion in teams &amp; businesses of all sizes is a core company strategy for Canva. Our group is doubling down on our premium teams products and new product initiatives for businesses, as well as building up a high-performing cross-functional GTM organisation consisting of Product, Growth, Marketing, Sales, Data &amp; more, to supercharge our growth.

A key pillar of our GTM engine is our Product-led Sales motion. This is a data &amp; product-led sales customer acquisition strategy that complements our successful self-serve engine, by offering a layer of low-touch human support via our team of Product Advocates. 

Our goal is to assist paid teams in small and medium businesses to onboard and rapidly experience success on Canva through a combination of low-touch conversion tactics, such as in-product chat, demos &amp; webinars.

Canva already counts many active users from over 85% of Fortune 1000 companies amongst our 80 million+ MAUs, and has over 5 million paid subscriptions. These numbers are growing rapidly every day, so we have a huge opportunity in front of us to build a world-class product-led sales motion that generates hundreds of millions of dollars in subscription revenue.

We are early on in our journey to make Canva a ubiquitous presence in teams and businesses, and there is a whole lot more to do to achieve our vision and so we are looking for a Lead to help us build our Product-led Sales org, and help propel us towards our goal of helping every team leverage the power of Canva as a visual communication tool. 

About you

You thrive in a collaborative cross-functional environment, working with Sales, Data, Product, Growth, Design, Marketing, and everyone else in-between to solve the highest impact problems for our users, in order to help the business grow. 

Continually learning and adapting, you strive to grow yourself and those around you. You love to take green-field opportunities and build solutions, teams &amp; processes to solve them. Living and breathing all things growth, you make data-informed, strategic decisions and deliver on them to lead your team to great results.

Growing our adoption and expansion in teams &amp; businesses of all sizes is a core company strategy at Canva. We are doubling down on our premium and new product initiatives for businesses, and building a cross-functional Go-To-Market (GTM) engine consisting of Product, Growth, Marketing, Sales and Data.

You have proven experience leading teams to success across borders and cultures, a collaborative approach, and the ability to drive outcomes.

You are targeting an opportunity to influence and impact the creation of a brand-new GTM strategy for one of the most exciting and inspiring companies in the world.

Data &amp; Analytics Engineering: 
Over the past 3 years, Canva has grown significantly, with a Data organisation that has gone from half a dozen people to over 150 engineers, analysts, and scientists. In this time Canva’s data stack has evolved to support Canva’s lightning fast growth and power Canva’s innovative global product. 

The Analytics Engineering specialty was created in August 2021 as part of our broader data community. Our mission is to grow a high performing specialty of central analytics engineers building our Data Warehousing Platforms and Data Services, as well as embedded engineers that sit within Business Teams supporting their goals.

Critically, we aim to establish a world class operating model connecting the central data platforms and services to the embedded engineers, building a connected ecosystem that supports agility and speed of delivery for all of our teams, while ensuring scalable outcomes and minimising duplication. 

About the position:
As the Head of Analytics Engineering, you will build and lead a rapidly growing team of Analytics Engineers that deliver data warehousing and analytics throughout the  business. 

In this role, we’re looking for a strategic leader to firmly establish the function while driving the strategic direction of our Data Services and connected analytics ecosystem. You will also work closely with Data Teams and Engineers to advocate best-practices and drive excellence in Analytics Engineering.

As part of the Data Leadership team, reporting to the Head of Data, you will collaborate closely with Data Subspecialty and Capability leaders, who are responsible for delivering against Canva’s Data Strategy to empower Canvanauts to do their best work, with the best data, to deliver magic to our customers.

About the role and the team 

The User Growth group is one of three groups which make up the Product Growth Supergroup - one of the biggest areas at Canva. 

Playing a critical role in Canva’s mission to empower the world to design, the User Growth Group does everything from building exciting new products and features to running tonnes of experiments and conducting research and analysis to grow Canva in new markets and categories. 

The group’s strategy is based on three pillars: 

1) delight first time users 
2) increase frequency of use (so customers want to use more products, more often, for longer and across more platforms) and 
3) improve our virality by building step change growth opportunities to ultimately grow our active user base. 

Composed of several product teams, the User Growth group’s impact spans our entire funnel (signup &amp; login, logged-out homepage, onboarding, post-publish, referral). The first experience subgroup is all about creating a delightful first experience so new users want to come back. It currently has three teams: the logged-out homepage, authentication and onboarding teams.

Hello dear problem solver! Our mission at Canva is to empower the world to design and since launching in 2013, we have grown exponentially, amassing over 86 million monthly active users across 190 different countries and a team of over 3,000 people… and the best bit is that we’ve only achieved 1% of what we know we’re capable of.
Our Smartmockups by Canva product help people and companies (especially designers, marketers and agencies) create engaging marketing materials, so-called mockups, to present their projects like never before. 

Our tech-stack 😮:
Our frontend is a single-page application written in React. We use Redux for the state management and the components are styled using CSS Modules. The mockup editor works on WebGL and HTML Canvas API. Smartmockups is basically a graphics editor that works directly in a browser. Because of this, we do a lot of things on the front end, not just marketing pages and displaying data from the API.
We develop a lot of interactive components for the editor ourselves (such as the image cropper for cropping images). The final rendering of images takes place on the client-side. The product is localized in 7 languages, including Chinese.
The backend is composed of microservices written in NodeJS and is completely Serverless (we use Lambda and other AWS services).

Our biggest challenges are: 
Scaling product for more than 85 millions active monthly users 🚀
Differences between our tech stack and Canva tech stack.

What you will do with us 🦹‍♀️:
 
Work on the best possible integration with design unicorn Canva to make sure our users have the best possible experience from the service 🤩
Work with product designers and founders to build a next-generation web application with a focus on an extraordinary client-side experience
Build efficient and reusable front end abstractions and systems
Identify and address performance bottlenecks
Participate in design and code reviews
Communicate with other team members to figure out the best solutions to difficult problems and challenges
Help to identify and communicate standard practices and methodologies for front end engineering
Interact with global Canva teams in Sydney, London or Wienna

Current challenging projects that we are working on are: 3D and Video mockups, Smartmockups tool in Canva and other Canva integrations. We are looking for a developer who will be as excited about our product and challenges that we are solving as we are!

What we ideally need 🤙:
Strong knowledge of JavaScript and web technologies (HTML/CSS)
Experience developing rich applications with HTML/CSS/JS
Ability to write high-performance, reusable code for UI components, including appropriate testing
Passion for performance debugging and benchmarking

What would really rock 🤩:
Experience with React.js, Next.js, Redux
Experience with 2D/3D graphics, video processing/rendering or animations (WebGL, HTML Canvas, SVGs) 🧑‍🎨
Experience with Node.JS or Java
A big plus would be experience with the development of graphic tools or the enthusiasm to learn it!

About the team

Canva’s entire vision revolves around “empowering the world to design”, but this happens through many channels and experiences—all of which require exceptional content. Content with a strong voice and empathy for our users is crucial for us to deliver on this vision. We need to hold a megaphone to our brand pillars and become best-in-class creators across every channel. 

As a Copywriter at Canva, it’s your mission to create content that makes complex things simple and to give ordinary people the ability to make extraordinary things. We place a strong emphasis on the success of our users, and content in all forms has a big impact on that. This could include copy for social advertising, branding campaigns, EDMs, landing pages, UI copy and more. 

About the Templates Team

Canva offers a vast collection of customizable templates for various design types, themes and topics. These templates, found on our templates page and on the editor, are professionally designed layouts that feature stunning elements from our massive media library and high-quality copy relevant to each design’s purpose or to user preference. 

Template copy refers to the text featured on these customizable layouts. Copywriters are sent the category (design type) and subcategory (theme) for each template request along with the specified text fields and character counts. It is their responsibility to supply the text required following these requirements and Canva’s writing guidelines. 
As a Copywriter at Canva you will have the opportunity to work on one of the fastest-growing platforms in the world and all the content that promotes and enriches it.

This is a rare opportunity for copywriters accustomed to working independently and are looking to develop their craft by challenging themselves creatively.


About the candidate

With over 50,000 professionally designed layouts and their corresponding landing pages, our Templates page brings in over 200k visits monthly. In line with our mission, we want to increase that by engaging our local audiences through the creation of bespoke templates. We need to ensure that the design templates we produce are of excellent quality and relevant to what people are looking for. 

For every template request, we need the high-quality copy to match. Having these copy available makes it easier for our designers to create more templates each week.

In total we have less than 20 people in engineering - we all still have a big impact and the ability to do crazy big things. Our Engineering consists of three teams - two of them are working on Canva integrations - Smartmockups product and Smartmockups tool in Canva.

Responsibilities include engineering strategy, resourcing/team building, managing performance and working collaboratively with product and design leadership partners to build and execute on the product roadmap while ensuring appropriate engineering processes and practises are in place to do so sustainably, and appropriate time is being spent scaling and maintaining our engineering systems.

About the team

Flourish, which recently joined the Canva family, is the world’s leading data storytelling tool. It enables anyone to create beautiful graphics and interactive stories without coding.

The team, mostly based in London, runs Flourish as a separate product while also adding new data storytelling features into Canva.

Since Flourish's launch in 2018, more than a million users have produced over 10 million graphics, which have racked up more than 20 billion views. Our customers range from leading newsrooms and Fortune 500 companies to NGOs, universities and government departments all over the world.


About the role

At Canva we believe data visualization is a critical visual communication tool for working professionals, businesses, students and educators alike.  But data visualization isn’t easy: getting to grips with Flourish and data storytelling concepts and best practices is something our customers need help, support and expert knowledge to master. 

This role will sit in the customer enablement team and is a critical contributor to the success of our customers and Flourish adoption.

You will be able to effectively communicate the benefits of, and how to use, Flourish and Canva. 

Enabling customers to use our software to deliver their own projects, by helping to transform their data visualizations from static, uninspiring and complicated content into meaningful, beautifully engaging data stories. 

You will work closely with the Flourish support, content, customer success and Canva teams to offer expert advice and support.  

Empowering our business users to design with data and get the most out of our tools.

We are a diverse team of designers, developers, data and visualisation specialists all working together to add the “wow” factor to our customers’ data-driven content and storytelling. 

We are open to making this a part-time role to encourage working parents or people that need more flexibility to apply. 

What you'll do

You’ll support some of our most important and biggest customers on many varied and interesting projects, helping enable their use and adoption of Flourish (and Canva) into their everyday work and giving them insight and ideas on how to make the best interactive data visualisation and storytelling content they can.

*Become a Flourish product and data storytelling expert.

*Support the customer enablement team on all aspects of customer project work, including
-Providing guidance on how to use our software whilst giving advice on best practices and tips and tricks on data visualization.
-Answering any questions, problem-solving and supporting customers to get past any blockers and resolve any issues. 
-Brainstorming and making examples. Use their data and your ideas to “Wow’ customers and show them the full potential of the Flourish and Canva tools.

*Build and maintain great working relationships with our customers. Listening carefully to their needs, understanding their data, objectives and audience. And knowing exactly what they want from their project. 

*Help us make our product even better: using your experience working with customers, together with your own ideas and insights, to help make Flourish and Canva better and easier to use. You’ll also help with basic testing, such as checking features on different devices or with different datasets and filing bugs on Github.


What we're looking for

We are seeking a bright, friendly person who is happy in a user-facing role. 

You’ll make an important contribution to the company, creating successful, beautiful and engaging Flourish graphics with customers. Enabling them to see how our products add value to their business to increase adoption. 

You are:

*A quick learner.  You will become a product expert, data vis and storytelling specialist. You think logically and are creative, with a good eye for design and detail. 
*Proactive, taking on tasks on your own and knowing how to prioritize without being micromanaged. 
*Positive, friendly and helpful. Someone who can develop strong working relationships with team members and our customers. 
*Confident in working in a customer-facing role, with large businesses and not-for-profits across the world.  
*An excellent communicator in written and spoken English, whether emailing or speaking to non-technical customers on their requirements or chatting to developers and designers on the team.

About the group

The Teams &amp; Subscriptions Growth group is on a mission to show the world the value of Canva at work and in the classroom. We’re laser focused on driving impact on key metrics for acquisition and retention of paid customers, adoption of Canva amongst teams and as an essential tool for collaboration.

We partner with other product groups and teams, leveraging our mature experimentation framework, data and research capabilities to maximise the impact and performance of all the amazing features that we launch on a regular basis.

We have come a long way, but we have huge company growth aspirations and crazy big goals; as a content designer joining the Teams &amp; Subscriptions Growth group you’ll be critical in helping us make Canva a household name.

About the subspecialty

We're on a mission to help our users fulfil their goals with clarity and joy.

We’re looking to achieve this by building an amazing team with a culture of clear and crisp writing. Our focus is on systems, not just sentences. We create and improve flows, not just the words. We seek to have deep impact on key areas, not just shallow impact everywhere. 

Content Design is a small and growing part of our Design specialty. Canva sees content as a crucial part of its ongoing success – and we’re really focused on improving our content experience. We have a fun, human voice that we want to do a better job of getting across to our users, instead of, you know, “generic UX writing” voice. 

We’re passionate about working together to create the future of Content Design at Canva; it’s not a top-down approach. 

Your opinion matters! You’ll also get lots of support from the diverse content team across the business. As soon as you arrive, we’ll be saying “Thank goodness you’re here!” 

The content design specialty collaborates closely with PMs, Designers, Engineers and Design Researchers to identify solutions that prioritise our users’ needs.

About the group/team
At Canva, we create tools that empower the world to design. Our mission is to democratize design and empower creativity for anyone and everyone, on every platform! Inspired by a team of talented thinkers, an amazing culture and remarkable growth trajectory – we’re out to change the world, one design at a time.

Since launch in August 2013 we have grown exponentially, amassing over 30 million active users across 190 different countries who have created more than 2 Billion designs. In late 2017 we set out to bring the world’s most loved design tool to the world’s largest internet market, China. We were thrilled to have launched Canva China in August 2018. We are one of the world’s fastest-growing technology companies and we have only achieved about 1% of what we are capable of!

About the role/specialty

The mission of Product Managers at Canva is to create the most accessible design tool for every person in the world. We believe that we can improve the world by empowering everyone to design and communicate visually. As a Product Manager at Canva you help set this vision, define what that future looks like, and build the products that get us there. 

Product Managers collaborate with business leaders to set the strategic direction, scope, and success metrics for product initiatives. We work across teams of designers, software engineers, marketers and analysts to ensure we're delivering an exceptional experience to all our users. We are responsible for implementing and collaborating on product strategy, road mapping, and prioritization as our product grows. 

It’s our responsibility to see products through their entire lifecycle—from concept through to validation, build, post-launch analytics and iterations. Every day is a different challenge—one day you might be in a room full of product designers preparing research and UX flows, the next you’ll be leading go-to-market efforts in collaboration with leaders and other teams.

About the team

To continue strengthening our content advantage, we launched Canva Creators in June 2020 - a platform which empowers everyone to submit their high-quality designs into the Canva content library. Our vision is to build the world’s best marketplace. Creators is a product in its hyper-growth phase on top of the exponentially growing company. While still at beta-launch, creators-published designs now contribute to more than 50% of usage by all Canva users, with over 500,000 templates added to the library from Creators in the last 3 months, a 500X YoY growth.

We believe Canva Creators has the potential to take Canva to the next level of scale for high-quality design content, and we want you to be central to that growth.

About the role

This role will be responsible for proactively monitoring, detecting, investigating and managing Creator fraud. The hyper-growth that the Creators program is going through is outstanding, but with this also comes an increase in attractiveness for fraudsters. Building the world’s best marketplace means not only empowering people in their potential to earn through submitting high-quality designs into the Canva content library, but also protecting our Creator communities by having a safe and trusted environment against bad actors. This role will help to improve the operational efficiency of our fraud detection and will interact across multiple specialities within the Creators team and make sure we are ready to scale towards Canva’s goal of reaching $2B AR.

About the role 

The Analytics Engineer empowers Canvanauts to discover insights from our data. They are a steward of organizational knowledge, not a researcher answering a specific question. Like a librarian, the analytics engineer curates the catalog so that the researchers can do their work more effectively.

The analytics engineer applies software engineering best practices on a daily basis. Their purpose is to maintain and operate the data platform to deliver well-defined, transformed, tested, documented, and code-reviewed data sets. 

We handle Billions of rows and Petabytes of data from hundreds of different sources - including events, databases, and third-party systems. We work in collaboration with multiple teams and stakeholders to support their decision making process. We work everyday to make Canva one of the most valuable companies in the world and to do the most good along the way. We are looking to grow our team and multiply our impact.
