User Experience at Wealthsimple:
We're a close-knit UX team made up of broadly skilled Product Designers. We're embedded on product teams so that we can be involved with projects from the get-go and work really closely with other disciplines at every stage of the process. We work purposefully and think big when it comes to our growth as a team and individuals. It's important to us that we have a collaborative and supportive environment to work in every day. Our empathy for our users sets the bar really high for the products and experiences we create.

Weâ€™re looking for multiple Staff Product Designers to join our R&amp;D UX Team!
Never heard of a Staff Designer? The role of Staff Designer is a level above Senior Designer in our Job Levels and equivalent to a Manager. Staff Designers do not typically have direct reports, though they may have formal 1:1 mentorship roles with others within their discipline. They are the standard-bearers for quality and consistency within their domain, and work with UX Managers to raise the bar for what we create. Every day looks different for our Staff Product Designers: You might be focused on executing high-priority, high-stakes project work as an individual contributor this week, pairing with Product Designers the next to help them take their work to the next level, and then partner with Product and Engineering Leaders to shape user-centric product strategy after.

We are hiring for multiple positions across our team to help lead design efforts.

About the team:

Credit policy is part of a new retail lending group at Wealthsimple and we want to build a team of exceptional lending professionals with diverse educational backgrounds.Â 

We are taking on green-field lending: starting with small data and growing through iteration and experimentation. The team is responsible for managing a suite of inclusive retail lending products in a way that optimizes risk &amp; return and delights our customers.Â 

The credit team is staffed with seasoned engineers, product managers, and data scientists and we need a credit policy leader who can collaborate with these teams to deliver strategies for approval, line management, pricing, limits, and authorization.Â 

This team is a great place to learn about the interplay of product, technology and risk and a great place to see your work deliver a big impact to the business.

As credit policy &amp; strategy lead you will play a pivotal role in managing the risk of Wealthsimpleâ€™s retail lending products.

Together our work will accelerate Wealthsimpleâ€™s goal to be the primary financial service provider to millions of Canadians.

You should have domain knowledge in retail lending, strong analytical skills, strong communication skills, and experience with cross-functional collaboration. You should be comfortable managing a small team and experienced enough to step in and get your hands dirty sometimes.Â 

We are building inclusive financial products and we want someone who is willing to challenge the status quo of what it means to be credit-worthy.
