If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.


The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a  Software Engineer you’ll have an opportunity to grow more quickly than you ever envisioned, as you contribute high-quality code directly to Palantir Gotham, Palantir Apollo, or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed at some of the most important institutions across the public and private sectors. You'll create features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers, each focusing on a specific aspect of a product. For example, you might join a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage communication and collaboration among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product.

As a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties.

SWE principles include: 

• Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.
• Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.


Technologies We Use

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:

• A variety of languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend
• Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux
• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

As a Software Engineer, you are involved throughout the product lifecycle - from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution and shipping while also being paired with a mentor dedicated to your growth and success. You'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that tackle them. One of the most effective ways to understand what our users need is to meet them. You may receive an opportunity to tour the assembly line at an auto-manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and difficulties.

SWE principles include: 

• Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end in spite of obstacles we may encounter.
• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other Software Engineers, Product Managers, Designers and Product Reliability Engineers. We also partner with our business development teams (Forward Deployed Engineers, Deployment Strategists) in order to understand and solve our customers' problems.
• Trust: We trust each other to effectively handle time and priorities, and don't micromanage. We want people to have the space to think for themselves, while feeling supported by their team.


Technologies We Use

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers that bring diverse experience - whether you’re a former university TA, switched to CS recently, or are a hackathon enthusiast — you'll build your skills to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:

• A variety of languages, including Java and Go for backend and Typescript for frontend
• Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, Elasticsearch, React, and Redux
• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

The Role

Are you excited about building world class platforms that power mission critical software at a huge scale? Apollo enables autonomous management and continuous deployment of software, wherever it is. We’re taking SAAS to where SAAS has not gone before: from on-premise, to various cloud providers, to disconnected environments (air-gapped), to strict accreditation frameworks including IL-5 and FedRAMP, and to the edge. You can read more about the problem Apollo was built to solve on our blog or watch our Apollo demo day.

As a Software Engineer on the Apollo platform you will build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world deploy software. You will be responsible for mission critical software powering deployment of software for both Palantir and its customers in the commercial and government space.

You have a curious mind, high bar for engineering quality and ability to work in a dynamic environment where the best idea wins. Apollo Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle. From idea generation, to design and prototyping, to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Software Engineers at Palantir build software at scale to transform how organizations around the world use data. As a Software Engineer, you'll contribute high-quality code to Palantir Gotham or Palantir Foundry: products that are deployed to the most important institutions in the public and private sector. You'll build features used by research scientists, aerospace engineers, intelligence analysts, and economic forecasters, in countries around the world. 

Palantir's Product Development organization is made up of small teams of Software Engineers. Each team focuses on a specific aspect of a product: for example, you might be part of a team that builds a Foundry front-end application, or a component of the Gotham release infrastructure. We encourage movement among teams to share context, skills, and experience, so you'll learn about many different aspects of each product. 

Software Engineers are involved throughout the product lifecycle, from idea generation, design, and prototyping to execution, and shipping. As a Software Engineer, you'll collaborate closely with technical and non-technical counterparts to understand our customers' problems and build products that solve them. We think the best way to understand what our users need is to meet them, so occasionally, you'll tour the assembly line at an auto manufacturer or join a counter-terror analyst at their desk to really understand their mission and their pain points. 

It doesn’t matter what languages you know when you join us, but it does matter that you can write clean, effective code and learn new languages quickly. Our software is constantly evolving, so we need engineers who can do the same. Alongside peers who bring diverse experience — startup founders, industry veterans, university TAs, and more — you'll build your skillset to apply the best technology to solve a given problem. Right now, we use:

	• A variety of languages, including Java and Go for back end and Typescript for front end
	• Open-source technologies like Cassandra, Spark, ElasticSearch, React, and Redux
	• Industry-standard build tooling, including Gradle, Webpack, and Github

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Around the world, data is being generated at an exponential rate, and many government agencies and commercial institutions worldwide are ill-equipped to handle data at scale. Palantir’s software helps these organizations build data assets that enables efficient analysis and more effective management of their data, empowering them to solve their most critical problems.

The Sales Team is responsible for getting Palantir’s software to these organizations. Sales Reps find, evaluate, and pursue new business opportunities for a targeted institution or geography, seeking partners whose missions, objectives, and values align with our own. Each institution is different and each country has its own way of procuring software, and Sales Reps see these distinctions as opportunities — for creative thinking, diligent research, and value creation. Successful Sales Reps tailor their approach to Palantir and to each unique opportunity, rather than relying on past strategies for selling other enterprise software.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves real problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Around the world, data is being generated at an exponential rate, and many government agencies and commercial institutions worldwide are ill-equipped to handle data at scale. Palantir’s software helps these organizations build data assets that enables efficient analysis and more effective management of their data, empowering them to solve their most critical problems.

The Sales Team is responsible for getting Palantir’s software to these organizations. Sales Reps find, evaluate, and pursue new business opportunities for a targeted institution or geography, seeking partners whose missions, objectives, and values align with our own. Each institution is different and each country has its own way of procuring software, and Sales Reps see these distinctions as opportunities — for creative thinking, diligent research, and value creation. Successful Sales Reps tailor their approach to Palantir and to each unique opportunity, rather than relying on past strategies for selling other enterprise software.

The Role

The Palantir Design Team is responsible for the human experience of using our software. Our team is growing rapidly, but we're committed to creating a tight-knit team environment that fosters trust, integrity, empathy, and growth. We work together in realizing a shared product vision, and regularly give feedback and critique to each other.

Designing at Palantir is a varied experience. On a given day, you might be: leading a design sprint for your product team; designing a micro-interaction to make a complex analytical task feel simple; and/or advocating for UX consistency by creating flexible, reusable UI components.

Core Responsibilities

•  Interaction and visual design. As a product designer, you'll be involved at every stage of design work. You'll help define early product concepts, flesh out the high-level workflow and micro-interactions of a feature, and execute on a crisp and effective visual design. You should have experience with some of the following mockup and prototyping tools: Sketch, Framer, Principle, Figma, Invision. 
•  User research. We frequently do informal user research, and value people who can be flexible with research processes and methodologies to achieve the right outcome. You'll often visit customer offices to interview and learn from the users we serve. You'll pair qualitative methods (e.g. scripted usability tests and contextual inquiry) with quantitative information, like product and usage metrics.
•  Prototyping. You will prototype—using software like Principle and Framer, or another favorite method—both to communicate your designs and validate your decisions.
•  Partnering with engineers. We work closely with product and forward deployed engineers to realize our design ideas. You'll treat engineers as partners and collaborate with them to prototype and build out products.
•  Awareness of how software interfaces are built. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript is appreciated. You don't need to be an expert—just fluent enough to collaborate with engineers, and know what's possible with frontend technologies. Resources and mentorship are available to designers who want to learn more.

Designers at Palantir have great autonomy over their work, so a wide skill set is necessary. However, many designers on the team are also passionate experts in one area. You might be the kind of designer who ships code every week, or the kind of designer who shares detailed user research findings with your team.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Product Design Team

We help to achieve connection and understanding. Our users must create knowledge from data in our software, potential customers and candidates need to understand and relate to the story of our company and the awesome work we do, and it’s our job to help tell these stories. 

Designers are highly valued in the company for our vision, our ability to learn and adapt, and our creativity and inventiveness. We’re growing rapidly, yet focused on creating a tight-knit group of people that enjoy working together in an atmosphere that fosters trust, integrity, empathy, and growth. We rigorously share and promote our ideas and constantly incorporate feedback and critique.

The Role

As a Product Designer, you are a generalist who spans many design disciplines: user research, information architecture, prototyping, ideation, interaction design, and sometimes visual design. You will visit our users, listen, investigate, learn, and ideate. You know that form informs function and usability—that the surface layer doesn’t exist in a vacuum.

Sometimes we’re out in front, exploring brand-new problem spaces, figuring out what to build, and sometimes you’re deep in the details of micro-interactions, figuring out how to build it. You lead feature teams in design exercises ranging from day-long design studios to week-long design sprints.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

The Palantir Design Team is responsible for the human experience of using our software. Our team is growing rapidly, but we're committed to creating a tight-knit team environment that fosters trust, integrity, empathy, and growth. We work together in realizing a shared product vision, and regularly give feedback and critique to each other.

Designing at Palantir is a varied experience. On a given day, you might be: leading a design sprint for your product team; designing a micro-interaction to make a complex analytical task feel simple; and/or advocating for UX consistency by creating flexible, reusable UI components.

Core Responsibilities

•  Interaction and visual design. As a product designer, you'll be involved at every stage of design work. You'll help define early product concepts, flesh out the high-level workflow and micro-interactions of a feature, and execute on a crisp and effective visual design. You should have experience with some of the following mockup and prototyping tools: Sketch, Framer, Principle, Figma, Invision. 
•  User research. We frequently do informal user research, and value people who can be flexible with research processes and methodologies to achieve the right outcome. You'll often visit customer offices to interview and learn from the users we serve. You'll pair qualitative methods (e.g. scripted usability tests and contextual inquiry) with quantitative information, like product and usage metrics.
•  Prototyping. You will prototype—using software like Principle and Framer, or another favorite method—both to communicate your designs and validate your decisions.
•  Partnering with engineers. We work closely with product and forward deployed engineers to realize our design ideas. You'll treat engineers as partners and collaborate with them to prototype and build out products.
•  Awareness of how software interfaces are built. Familiarity with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Typescript is appreciated. You don't need to be an expert—just fluent enough to collaborate with engineers, and know what's possible with frontend technologies. Resources and mentorship are available to designers who want to learn more.

Designers at Palantir have great autonomy over their work, so a wide skill set is necessary. However, many designers on the team are also passionate experts in one area. You might be the kind of designer who ships code every week, or the kind of designer who shares detailed user research findings with your team.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Around the world, data is being generated at an exponential rate, and many government agencies and commercial institutions worldwide are ill-equipped to handle data at scale.

A successful Partnerships Manager tailors their approach to each unique opportunity.

Armed with a deep knowledge of the product and its real-world applicability, you will cultivate existing relationships and work diligently to build new ones. You are motivated by the knowledge that the software Palantir sells is directly responsible for uncovering fraud, stopping wrongdoing, and saving lives.

Early application deadline is Tuesday, September 6 2022 at 9:00 AM PDT. Final deadline to apply is Monday, October 3 2022 at 9:00 AM PDT.

We know the path to tech looks different for everyone, and we believe in providing opportunities for people of all backgrounds to accelerate their personal and technical growth in preparation for a successful, impactful career. We launched Palantir Path to reach students who may not have had prior exposure to technical opportunities in an academic or industry setting, or who are earlier in their engineering journey, especially those from underrepresented communities.

As a Palantir Path intern, you'll be invested in from day one - and challenged accordingly with high-impact work! There's no sitting in a classroom all day or writing code that doesn’t live beyond the summer. Instead, Path interns join a team of dedicated, motivated engineers supporting a specific product or Palantir customer in solving multi-faceted, open-ended problems. You will be paired with a mentor who will help you learn to build real-world software and to think critically about how problems can — and can't — be solved with technology. You'll also find our internal community is full of people who are excited to meet you, build your community, and further your development and self-discovery outside of your project work.

At the end of the summer, with real-world experience and concrete feedback under your belt, you'll be better equipped to make the most of your remaining studies and tackle future engineering challenges with confidence!

We're currently welcoming applications for Summer 2023 opportunities. We especially encourage students from communities that are historically underrepresented in STEM to apply. This includes (but is not limited to) individuals from ethnic/racial minority groups, women, veterans, individuals with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.

The Role

Implementation Security Engineers work directly with Palantir’s U.S. Government customers to ensure that Palantir’s software solutions meet and are accredited to Government information security requirements. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for their most critical operations and our ability to successfully implement and demonstrate the security of our software is essential to customer trust and mission success. We're seeking dedicated and motivated individuals with Systems Administration, Software Development, or Systems Engineering backgrounds to join our team to support solution accreditation for government agencies. You will collaborate with other Palantir engineers to ensure security policies and settings are in place, build standardized security documentation, and generate evidence of compliance once settings have been applied. You will assemble artifacts and evidence into an organized repository and serve as the primary point of contact for one or more U.S. Government customers on security and compliance requirements and questions. You will also work with Palantir software developers and architects to recommend specific technical features in new or existing software in order to ensure compliance.

There is no typical day for our Implementation Security Engineers. We operate software in diverse environments around the world, including AWS, Azure, on-premises, and at all classification levels. Correspondingly, each customer has different security requirements. We will rely on you to ensure the ongoing security and trust of these clients via hands-on access and coordination with other teams. In this role, you will learn every day.

You will also work with Palantir software developers and architects to recommend specific technical features in new or existing software in order to ensure compliance.

There is no typical day for our Implementation Security Engineers. We operate software in diverse environments around the world, including AWS, Azure, on-premises, and at all classification levels. Correspondingly, each customer has different security requirements.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

We build software that helps our customers answer their most critical questions: what is causing the products we manufacture to fail? Are our traders engaging in risky activity? Where did this strain of E. coli originate, and who else could it affect? As a Full Stack Developer, you architect the interfaces that our customers use to solve their biggest problems.

The mission of a Full Stack Developer is to design and build capabilities that let users visualize and interact with their data to meet their analytical needs. To achieve that mission, Full Stack Developers are involved in all stages of the product development and deployment lifecycle: idea generation, user interviews, planning, design, prototyping, execution, shipping, and iteration.

You might spend one day interviewing users to suss out the questions they need to ask of their data and the next brainstorming mockups with Product Designers. Then it's time to take on the hard technical problems: figuring out how to make it possible for a user to explore the full range of data, at vast scale, then dive deep to understand each data point at a granular level.

The Role

Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 

As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.

Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team.

FDSE Interns are treated just like full time engineers, with significant freedom and ownership over their work. Interns take responsibility for real world projects and outcomes that our customers rely on.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) understand our customers’ greatest pain points and design end-to-end solutions to address them. FDSEs solicit constant feedback on their work from both customers and colleagues, improving our products over time with rapid iteration cycles.

FDSEs deploy ground breaking technical solutions to solve our customers’ hardest problems. Projects often start with a nebulous question like “Why are we losing customers?” or “How can we more effectively identify instances of money laundering?” FDSEs lead the way in developing a solution, from high-level system design and prototyping to application development and data integration. As an FDSE, you leverage everything around you: Palantir products, open source technologies, and anything you and your team can build to drive real impact.

You work with customers around the globe, where you gain rare insight into the world’s most important industries and institutions. We help our customers detect insider trading, improve disaster relief, fight healthcare fraud, and more. Each mission presents different challenges, from the regulatory environment to the nature of the data to the user population. You will work to accommodate all aspects of an environment to drive real technical outcomes for our customers.

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.

Our Principles

• Impact: We take on meaningful and challenging projects that change the world for the better.
• Ownership: We see projects through from beginning to end, working through any obstacles we may encounter.
• Collaboration: We work internally with people from a variety of backgrounds — such as other FDSEs, product teams, and Deployment
• Strategists. We also work externally with our customers, often on site, to understand and solve their problems.
• Trust: We trust each other to effectively manage time and priorities and give people the space to think for themselves.
• Growth: We encourage ourselves and our peers to seek new challenges and opportunities for growth, as well as find new ways to innovate and share knowledge.
• Learning: We often face entirely novel problems where we need to pick up a lot of new knowledge and learn how to use it to make progress. We believe experiential learning is one of the best teachers.

What We Value

• Strong engineering background, preferred in fields such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Software Engineering, Physics, and Data Science.

A World-Changing Company

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Forward Deployed Software Engineers (FDSEs) work directly with customers to quickly understand their greatest problems and design and implement solutions to use data against them. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations, and projects often start with an open ended question like “Why are we delaying so many flights?” or “How can we better identify instances of money laundering?” As an FDSE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to help organizations use their data to drive a real impact in the world. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions. 

As an FDSE your responsibilities look similar to those of a startup CTO: you’ll work in small teams with minimal supervision and own end-to-end execution of high stakes projects. Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team.

You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.

Chez Palantir, nous concevons des logiciels qui offrent des solutions aux problèmes les plus importants au monde. Nous établissons des partenariats avec les plus puissantes institutions afin de transformer l’utilisation de leurs données. Nos logiciels sont utilisés afin d’empêcher des attaques terroristes, découvrir de nouveaux médicaments, déjouer des fraudes bancaires, et bien plus encore. Si ces types de projets vous intéressent, nous serions heureux de vous accueillir parmi nous.

Le poste

Les Forward Deployed Software Engineer (FDSE) travaillent directement avec les clients afin de comprendre rapidement leurs problèmes les plus importants et ainsi concevoir et implémenter des solutions qui vont utiliser cette donnée afin de résoudre ces problèmatiques. Nos clients s’appuient sur les plateformes de Palantir pour certaines de leurs opérations les plus critiques, et les projets commencent souvent par une question ouverte comme « Pourquoi nos vols sont-ils si souvent retardés ? » ou « Comment pouvons-nous identifier plus efficacement les cas de blanchiment d’argent ? ».
En tant que FDSE, vous appliquez votre capacité à résoudre les problèmes, votre créativité et vos compétences techniques pour aider les organisations à exploiter au mieux leurs données et avoir ainsi un impact réel sur le monde. Vous avez l’opportunité d’obtenir des informations rares et de contribuer à certaines des industries et institutions les plus importantes au monde. 

 En tant que FDSE, vos responsabilités ressemblent à celles d’un directeur technique de startup : vous travaillez en petites équipes avec une supervision minimale et êtes responsable de l’exécution « end-to-end » de projets à enjeux élevés. Votre journée peut consister à discuter de l’architecture avec d’autres ingénieurs, à gérer des données à grande échelle, à coder une application web personnalisée, à discuter avec l’équipe dirigeante du client ou à établir une stratégie pour votre équipe.

Que vous aspiriez à devenir entrepreneur ou leader en ingénierie, nous pensons que Palantir est le meilleur endroit (avec le meilleur esprit d’équipe) afin d’apprendre à le devenir. Vous apprendrez à décortiquer un problème et à en comprendre les coûts ainsi que les conséquences de sa solution. Vous apprendrez de nouvelles technologies et de nouveaux langages, et vous pourrez également les développer vous-même. Vous travaillerez de manière autonome et prendrez des décisions de manière indépendante, au sein d’une communauté qui vous soutiendra et vous mettra au défi tout au long de votre parcours et de votre développement.

Nos principes

• Impact : Nous entreprenons des projets significatifs et ambitieux qui rendent le monde meilleur.
Responsabilité : Nous menons nos projets du début à la fin, en surmontant tous les obstacles que nous pourrions rencontrer.
• Collaboration : Nous travaillons en interne avec des personnes d’horizons variés, tels que d’autres FDSE, des équipes Produits et des Deployment Strategists. Nous travaillons également en externe avec nos clients, souvent sur site, afin de comprendre et résoudre leurs problèmes.
• Confiance : Nous nous faisons confiance les uns aux autres afin de gérer efficacement le temps et les priorités et donner aux individus l’espace nécessaire pour réfléchir par eux-mêmes.
• Développement : Nous nous engageons et encourageons les personnes à rechercher de nouveaux défis et des nouvelles opportunités de croissance, ainsi qu’à trouver de nouvelles façons d’innover et de partager les connaissances.
• Apprentissage : Nous sommes souvent confrontés à des problèmes totalement inédits, pour lesquels nous devons engranger beaucoup de nouvelles connaissances et apprendre à les utiliser pour avancer. Nous considérons que l’apprentissage par l’expérience est l’une des meilleures écoles.
 
Le profil recherché

• Solide expérience en ingénierie, de préférence dans  des domaines tels que l’informatique, les mathématiques, le Software  Engineer et la physique.
• Un état d’esprit hautement analytique et la volonté  de résoudre les problèmes techniques liés aux structures de données, aux  systèmes de stockage, à l’infrastructure cloud, aux frameworks front-end  et à d’autres outils techniques.

Your day might span discussing architecture with fellow engineers, wrangling massive-scale data, coding a custom web app, speaking with customer executives, or establishing strategy for your team. 

Whether you aspire to be an entrepreneur or an engineering leader, we believe Palantir is the best place — with the best colleagues — to learn how. You’ll learn how to unpack a problem and understand the costs and consequences of its solution. You’ll learn new technologies and languages, and even develop them yourself. You’ll work autonomously and make decisions independently, within a community that will support and challenge you as you grow and develop.

At Palantir, we’re passionate about building software that solves problems. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.


The Role

Forward Deployed Operations Engineers (FDOEs) work with existing customers or global teams to support the day to day operations of a Foundry deployment. Our customers rely on Palantir’s platforms for some of their most critical operations; as an FDOE, you’ll apply your problem solving ability, creativity, and technical skills to support organizations’ Foundry stacks and critical workflows. You’ll have the opportunity to gain rare insight into and contribute to some of the world’s most important industries and institutions.

Every day at Palantir is different: we’re constantly evolving to better respond to customer needs, and FDOEs are embedded with our internal support and business teams to maximize the outcomes of our deployed products and workflows. You are a resourceful, tenacious, and agile problem solver who is able to work both collaboratively and independently to resolve difficult and nebulous technical issues, as well as work productively with external customers to debug and resolve their problems. This includes creating new data pipelines and customer workflows, building health metrics and automated alerts, fixing bugs in pipelines and products, and developing and documenting strategies for engaging with customer support.

Every Palantirian is encouraged to play to their personal strengths, so there is no “one size fits all” approach to engineering at Palantir. The scope of this role is intentionally broad so that people can find their strengths and grow in a way that excites them.

The Role

As an Engineering Manager, you will lead a team responsible for mission critical infrastructure efforts that allow our engineers, business and product to scale across a large number of environments. You care deeply about your team, invest in their personal growth and support them in maximizing their impact to the business. You love developing, coaching and growing people across different subject areas and crafts. 

You have a deep systems background and value technical excellence, and use that to guide the team towards well-engineered and durable solutions. While you aren’t expected to spend a large percentage of time coding, you are expected to be able to evaluate and raise the technical bar, and help others attain it. You will play a part in engineering, design reviews, code reviews, and will contribute to the code base directly when needed. You lead by example rather than authority. 

You can effectively develop a high-trust, inclusive environment within the team. Any room that you enter should have more certainty and a firmer plan by the time that you leave it. You may walk into a situation where people have lost track of their goals and after your involvement, you get everyone aligned on a clear path forward. You remove unimportant details, distill complex situations to their essence, and get the right decision-maker to make a call – even if it’s not you. 

The core infra team is responsible for building the Kubernetes based infrastructure and API platform on top of which we deploy Palantir’s software offerings (Foundry, Gotham). The environment management team is responsible for building out our service management infrastructure. You can read more about the problem statement here.

At Palantir, we’re driven to solve the world's most critical and challenging problems, and believe that building software to enable human decision making is the most effective vector. We partner with the most important institutions in the world to transform how they use data and technology. Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. 

What We're About

At its core, the Deployment Strategist role centers around leveraging data in operational and real-world action. Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to protect their troops, manufacture high-quality products, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver aid to refugees safely is to make better use of their data. Deployment Strategists are responsible for turning that hunch into reality.

If you believe in the transformative power of data and technology and in your own ability to bring that power to bear against complex problems, we want to meet you.

What We Do

As a Deployment Strategist, you'll work as part of a driven and creative team of Engineers, Product Designers, and other Deployment Strategists to deploy software against the most challenging problems our world faces. Your mission is to synthesize disconnected streams of thought into a cohesive understanding of what the most important problem is, what the data means, what the product needs, what users are motivated by, and where the impact could be. 

Deployment Strategists are do-ers who immerse themselves in our customers' most intricate workflows, partner with customer teams and explore the data, and dive into the product landscape to enable us to scale. A select number of Deployments Strategists may also be deployed to Palantir internal teams and problems. In this role, the problems you'll tackle will require a curious and analytical mindset, a sharp intuition for product, and a strong degree of user empathy to ultimately empower our customers to make better decisions.

Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to protect their troops, manufacture high-quality products, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver aid to refugees safely is to make better use of their data. Deployment Strategists are responsible for turning that hunch into reality.

If you believe in the transformational power of data and technology and in your own ability to bring that power to bear against complex problems, we want to meet you.

What We Do

As a Deployment Strategist, you'll work as part of a driven and creative team of Engineers, Product Designers, and other Deployment Strategists to deploy software against the most challenging problems our world faces. Your mission is to synthesize disconnected streams of thought into a cohesive understanding of what the most important problem is, what the data means, what the product needs, what users are motivated by, and where the impact could be. 

Deployment Strategists are do-ers who immerse themselves in our customers' most intricate workflows, partner with customer teams and explore the data, and dive into the product landscape to enable us to scale. A select number of Deployments Strategists may also be deployed to Palantir internal teams and problems. In this role, the problems you'll tackle will require a curious and analytical mindset, a sharp intuition for product, and a strong degree of user empathy to ultimately empower our customers to make better decisions.

The Role

We're looking for a Content Strategist to join a cross-functional group of creatives who are responsible for communicating Palantir's work and values.

Our software has been used to stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in global financial markets, and more. If these types of projects excite you, we'd love for you to join us.

The Role

Our products support some of the most important and impactful work in the world, including defense, intelligence, and commercial applications. We are trusted by our customers to protect their mission-critical information in the face of advanced persistent threats. The mission of the Application Security Team is to enable developers to be highly productive, agile, and produce the most secure software possible. Given the mission critical work that Palantir does, investments in application security have never been more important.

As an Application Security Engineer, you will be hands-on and have wide-ranging impact for the security of Palantir:
•   Product security reviews. You will perform full-scope security reviews of our current and future product and service portfolio. This includes whitebox, greybox, and blackbox assessments. You will work with offensive security teams, engineering teams, and other members of the InfoSec organization to harden our products against our dedicated adversaries. 
•   Architecture and design. You will be the security subject matter expert for product architects and engineers. You will threat model, assess risks, and help implement security controls and mitigations to address identified issues. You will directly steer the design of our products to ensure we are secure-by-default. 
•   Strategic security initiatives. You will be empowered to own transformational security initiatives that impact the whole company. Members of the Application Security Team have implemented software supply chain security controls (e.g., in-toto), implemented hardware-backed GPG key signing for commits, developed new security services, implemented security automation, or worked on massive-scale security problems. 
•   Vulnerability identification and analysis. You will be responsible for finding new and novel ways to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities in our products. This includes static and dynamic code analysis, security scanning, investigation of security reports from InfoSec, our bug bounty program, or other trusted partners, and direct work with our incident response team on product security issues and incidents. 

This role has wide-reaching impact, strong autonomy, and the resources and empowerment to make significant security improvements across all Palantir. The skills and background of successful candidates may vary highly, but curiosity, tenacity, and a drive to be a world-class security engineer are the underpinnings of our team.

You will work with offensive security teams, engineering teams, and other members of the InfoSec organization to harden our products against our dedicated adversaries. 
•   Architecture and design. You will be the security subject matter expert for product architects and engineers. You will threat model, assess risks, and help implement security controls and mitigations to address identified issues. You will directly steer the design of our products to ensure we are secure-by-default. 
•   Strategic security initiatives. You will be empowered to own transformational security initiatives that impact the whole company. Members of the Application Security Team have implemented software supply chain security controls (e.g., in-toto), implemented hardware-backed GPG key signing for commits, developed new security services, implemented security automation, or worked on massive-scale security problems. 
•   Vulnerability identification and analysis. You will be responsible for finding new and novel ways to identify and resolve security vulnerabilities in our products. This includes static and dynamic code analysis, security scanning, investigation of security reports from InfoSec, our bug bounty program, or other trusted partners, and direct work with our incident response team on product security issues and incidents. 

This role has wide-reaching impact, strong autonomy, and the resources and empowerment to make significant security improvements across all Palantir. The skills and background of successful candidates may vary highly, but curiosity, tenacity, and a drive to be a world-class security engineer are the underpinnings of our team.
